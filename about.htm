    <p class="article01">The core technology owned by PacketX is the software-based Deep Packet Inspection engine empowered by multicore network processor. Actually, Deep Packet Inspection, shortly DPI, already takes the key roles on network security, advanced network management as well as internet data mining and many content-related analysis. PacketX noticed this trend and devote our resource on innovative applications with our own DPI engine for three fields:</p>
    <h3>Sophisticated Network Visibility: GRISM</h3>
    <div class="article02">
      <p>Network visibility infrastructure is the supporting layer to aggregates the raw packets from live networks and then dispatching to the upper layer, the analysis application farms such as intrusion detection, troubleshooting, antivirus and so on which need to inspect the live packets. </p>
      <p>PacketX’s product, GRISM, is able to classify the packets according to user-defined sophisticated signatures so that to deliver the right packets to the right application. More delivering accuracy means more application resource efficiency. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, it is the best choice to use GRISM to build network visibility infrastructure on the progressively expansion network since GRISM capacity is linearly scalable. </p>

    <h3>Packet Stream Recording and Analysis: TURING </h3>
    <div class="article03">
      <p>PacketX provides the innovative analysis system, TURING, on top of network visibility infrastructure. It is able to record the packet streams from live network, replay them and further analyze them by leveraging PacketX DPI engine. </p>
      <p>TURING is good for technical professionals to trace the unclassified events or find out the root cause behind the common network issues. Many off-line analysis tools are pure software so that performance becomes poor when doing analysis on a large recorded stream. Comparing to them, the analysis processing of TURING is speed up by the hardware architecture to get the outstanding performance: inspecting the packets in line rate.</p>

    <h3>Bridge network packets and BigData: Packet2Big</h3>
      <p>Just like many marketing searches are to analyze and profile the human behaviors in the physical world, people are now interested in the human behaviors in the cyber space and intend to do more study on them: for example, to know which news articles attract more eye balls; to know which service is the bandwidth killer or to know if location is an important factor to influence Internet access. Without any doubt, those answers relies on Big Data analysis.</p>
      <p>Internet access, xDSL/Cable/3G/4G…, and data center service providers all concern this new topic mentioned above. Knowing subscriber behaviors could help them to form the better marketing strategy for raising ARPU. Moreover, the enterprise customers also like to get the similar intelligences about their own network traffic for internal audit. Thus, they may trivially come to the Internet access service providers with the query: A new business is coming.</p>
    </div>
    <p>However, there exist a gap between network packets and Big Data analysis: the database cannot directly handle “packets” but need at least structured records. To tackle this, PacketX provides the Packet2Big program to bridge the packets and Big Data database. It can extract the metadata from network packets to represent the user behaviors while the schema of metadata could be customized to fit end users’ requirements.</p>
    <p>Simply to say, we would like to alchemize the packets into the valuable information to fulfill our customers’ expectations!</p>
